# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to fix the PyInstaller build issues in the Hameln Novel Scraper project. The current build command `pyinstaller --clean HamelnNovelSaver.spec` fails due to import errors, missing modules, and inconsistent class names between the refactored and legacy versions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PyInstaller build to complete successfully, so that I can distribute the application as a standalone executable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pyinstaller --clean HamelnNovelSaver.spec` THEN the build SHALL complete without import errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the executable SHALL be created in the dist/ directory
3. WHEN I run the executable THEN it SHALL start without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent class names and imports across all modules, so that there are no runtime import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hameln_hybrid.py imports HamelnFinalScraperLegacy THEN the import SHALL succeed
2. WHEN the GUI fallback mode is used THEN it SHALL find the correct scraper class
3. WHEN any module imports from hameln_scraper package THEN all imports SHALL resolve correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced modules in the spec file to exist and be properly implemented, so that PyInstaller can bundle them correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PyInstaller processes hiddenimports THEN all listed modules SHALL exist
2. WHEN the application runs THEN all required functionality SHALL be available
3. WHEN modules are imported at runtime THEN no ModuleNotFoundError SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the hybrid application to work in both GUI and CUI modes, so that I can use it regardless of my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GUI environment is available THEN the application SHALL start in GUI mode
2. WHEN GUI environment is not available THEN the application SHALL fallback to CUI mode
3. WHEN either mode is used THEN the core scraping functionality SHALL work correctly
